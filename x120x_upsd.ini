# Time the system must already be running to warmup the batteries for charging or discharging 
# (+10C env temp is advised)
# By charging once the system has run for some time the pi has warmed up the batteries
# warmup_time: 60

# Instead or additionally to warmup time a temperature sensor attached to the
# lithium cells can also help to protect the cells agains both too low and too high temparatures during
# charging and discharging. Currently DHT22 and DHT11 are tested.
# Format for DHT22/DHT11 is  <sensortype>,<GPIO pin>,<PULL_UP/NO_PULL_UP>
# GPIO pin is not the same as board pin. Default for 1wire is GPIO4, board pin 7
# PULL_UP is use of the internal PULL_UP resistor is necessay or if a resisor is being used.
# temperature_sensor_type = DHT22,4,PULL_UP

# Use a PID file. Not necessary with systemd.
# PID_FILE = "/var/run/X1202X_UPSD.pid"

# What to do if the software is started without the power adaptor available.
# Default it will use the UPS and battery parameters set. But if your usage
# could demand the system to powerup and stay available, the following setting
# will tell the daemon what to do.
# standard - do nothing (default)
# run_till_minimums - run the system until either of the previously defined voltage and capacity mininums are reached
# run_till_protect  - run the system until the protection voltage (3.0V) is hit. Combining this with the 'hidden' 
#                     option to disable this protection will run the system down to the hardware minimum. This may
#                     not be advisable as it could damage your battery. However, it is there if you need it.

# so you will not impact the lifetime of your sdcard/usb/ssd/nvme. 
# For example /run if the daemon is run as a systemd service. Or /run/user/1000 if you run this in
