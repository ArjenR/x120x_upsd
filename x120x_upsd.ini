# Maximum voltage to charge battery to. 4.2 volt is hardware default.
# Set this to 0 to only charge by load percentage
max_voltage: 0

# Volt level for shutdown. Keep this above 3.2 for life of battery.
min_voltage: 3.5 

# Max charge capacity percentage
max_charge_capacity: 80

# Min charge capacity percentage on which to shutdown
min_charge_capacity: 20

# Schedule for reporting battery state. Uses cron format

# Max time for (AC) power to be off. 0 = ignore value.
ac_max_downtime: 5

# Time the system must already be running to warmup the batteries for charging or discharging 
# (+10C env temp is advised)
# By charging once the system has run for some time the pi has warmed up the batteries

# Use a PID file. Not necessary with systemd.

# What to do if the software is started without the power adaptor available.
# Default it will use the UPS and battery parameters set. But if your usage
# could demand the system to powerup and stay available, the following setting
# will tell the daemon what to do.
# standard - do nothing (default)
# run_till_minimums - run the system until either of the previously defined voltage and capacity mininums are reached
# run_till_protect  - run the system until the protection voltage (3.0V) is hit. Combining this with the 'hidden' 
#                     option to disable this protection will run the system down to the hardware minimum. This may
#                     not be advisable as it could damage your battery. However, it is there if you need it.
